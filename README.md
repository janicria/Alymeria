# About

*add desc here*

## Demo
Please note that this game is currently in it's pre-release 'Pre-alpha' phase, meaning that many sprites have misplaced textures and menus may have some unusable buttons

This also means that you can also find experimental builds at the path /Releases/Experimental/ (updated weekly) There is also a README file explaining what experimental features each build contains (not guaranteed to run ~smoothly~ at all).

## Releases

Changelogs are stored at 'patch notes.txt'
(I guess you could also look at the commit history if you wanted, though it's mainly internal stuff so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ )

You can also find my design doc at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-JKUbbNwLlr0Cf3xtYCXf1nt2JtN55ohAl-p8EhhLDE

# Installation

## Windows

Go to the latest release on the releases page (https://github.com/janicria/Alymeria/releases) and download the file named Alymeria-[VERSION].exe (windows may warn you before running it)

i.e: Download 'Alymeria-0.2.exe' under release 'Version 0.2'

## Linux

Go to the latest release on the releases page (https://github.com/janicria/Alymeria/releases) and download the file named Alymeria-[VERSION].x86_64 (may need to make executable)

i.e: Download 'Alymeria-0.2.x86_64' under release 'Version 0.2'

# Saving & Logging

All versions of Alymeria share the same directory for storing save and log files, which can be found at:

```
Windows: C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Alymeria

Linux: ~/.local/share/Alymeria
```

This also means that switching versions will overwrite previous versions' save and log files.

## Demo
Please note that this game is currently in it's pre-release 'Alpha' phase, meaning that many sprites don't make any sense and menus may have some unusable buttons

Just clone (or download via zip then extract) this repository and bam, you've installed my game

To update the game just get the latest version of this repository by whatever means you want (re-downloading, pulling, etc)

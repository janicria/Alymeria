Changelogs are stored at 'patch notes.md'
(I guess you could also look at the commit history if you wanted, though it's mainly internal stuff so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ )

## Demo
Please note that this game is currently in it's pre-release 'Alpha' phase, meaning that many sprites don't make any sense and menus may have some unusable buttons

## Linux
Either go to the latest release on the releases page and download Alymeria[VERSION].x86_64, or download the executable file located at Linux/Alymeria[VERSION].x86_64 with the HIGHEST SEMANTIC VERSION

# Launching

# Credits
In case you didn't catch them in game or I haven't implemented them yet (oops)

# About

*add desc here*

## Demo
Please note that this game is currently in it's pre-release 'Alpha' phase, meaning that many sprites don't make any sense and menus may have some unusable buttons

This also means that you can also find 'Beta builds' in the /Releases/'Beta Builds/ directory

## Releases

Changelogs are stored at 'patch notes.md'
(I guess you could also look at the commit history if you wanted, though it's mainly internal stuff so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ )

You can also find my planning doc at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-JKUbbNwLlr0Cf3xtYCXf1nt2JtN55ohAl-p8EhhLDE

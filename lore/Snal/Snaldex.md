## SNALDEX

It was the beginning, the start of all time; when Snal decided to create the world.
It was an empty expanse of void, when Snal decided to create it all.
After the creation, the world was plain and empty, for there was no life worth living in it
And so Snal created the life that was worth living in the world; and we were made

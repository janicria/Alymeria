Notes: An ancient species of arachnid, which live in both of Alymeria's forests
and have more intelligence than they look. They are often found in large families, 
which often contain upwards of 60 memebers. However most spiders stay together in 
close groups of 3-4, and only meet up with other members of their family in times 
of great need or war. They mostly feast on small insects though occasinaly capture 
and eat intruders or spider's from other families when running low on food stocks.
